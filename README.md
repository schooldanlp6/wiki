## Documentation
### Installer Script
The installer script creates some basic directories and files needed for the package manager. They will be well documented and are allowed to be used for other purposes.

The installer script contains the working directory of Avdaon OS Package GUI. It is /etc/aospac

It has a file in it called repos and a directory called repos.d (the last one is currently not used but I still included it)
